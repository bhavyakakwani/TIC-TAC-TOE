# Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe (also known as noughts & crosses, or Xs & Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The **TIC-TAC-TOE GAME** is designed to perform the following tasks:

1) Create a new player profile
2) Play the game
3) Display record of a player
4) Display record of all players rank wise
5) Modify a player profile (Change your Password)
6) Delete a player profile

Thus, by this project the user can play his/her favourite game with ease and check his score and rank at any moment.
